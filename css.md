What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
- Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations. Inline styles have higher priority over any styles defined in external style sheets. When an !important is used in a style declaration it overrides everything else.

What is the difference between resetting and normalizing css?
- Resetting css means removing all built in styling from all elements.
- Normalizing: making elements look consistent across all browsers
